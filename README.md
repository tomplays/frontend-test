Exercise :

- Create an angular project with the latest version.
- Install Bootstrap.
- Use Sass

- This page must contain: a multi-tag search engine, the result of searching for 3 x 3 images, a pagination.
- Add a layer of unit test and end to end.


Please create your branch with a commit by feature then submit your pull request on this repository



Note:

  The concept of 'tag' search doesn't exist on Giphy api (except for 'random' search).
  "Multiple-tags" search is in fact a fulltext search (string)
  "layer of unit test and e2e" feature is included into angularCli
